# CSC543-Nim-Game

## List of Functionality
- Cards glow when hovered over
- Turns are counted and displayed on the page
- Button to submit the card selection and pass the turn
- An option to bring up an element with instructions
    - A video/gif demo of how to play, to be included with instructions
- A reset game button
- A front-end script to manage the page
- A separate module to manage the game state, could be front or back end
- An app.js to manage the server-side routing. Will return the landing game page


## Thoughts
- Consider a js DOM as a stretch goal\(server-side html struct)
- Think about game state data structure \(int\[] for count of cards in row, maybe something else would be better?)
    - Win state is all zeros?
 
- Add a sign up / sign in page
- Add a score page
